# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project leverages Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance breast cancer detection accuracy. The CNN model analyzes biopsy images to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors. Trained on a large dataset, the model was evaluated for accuracy, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in breast cancer detection. However, further validation is necessary to ensure reliability in real-world medical applications.
